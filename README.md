# Trendly
Trendly is a tool that provides a summarized and interactive view of data from Google Trends. 
The target users of this project are researchers and people who are interested in gaining better understanding of trends spikes and how people search for those trends.
The tool provides the users convenient and organized diverse views that facilitate the initial research process needed for understanding the target domain. 
This summary of the data allows users to identify optional connections between trends and better understand how the researched topic may divide into different subsections. 
Consequently, it may help the researcher get new leads for his research.
The tool contains two main features, both displaying data based on the user interests (search terms, time, location etc.).

## Clusterly
An interactive grouping of top queries that corresponds to a pool of topics (Knowledge Graph entities) that are related to the terms the user inserted. 

## Histogramy
A trends view displaying two charts along a given period of time, location  and category. If provided, the trends in the charts will be related to a given term.
